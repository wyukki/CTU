**Desktop chess game in Java**

Authors: Volodymyr Semenyug, Roman Danilchenko

Assignment was to create an ordinary chess game with graphics (SwingX or JavaFX, we've decided to use SwingX).
Also we had to implement timer without standard Timer class (i.e. with threads).
To start game, run main function in Game class.

It was our first big project, so the code is a huge mess, only board class has more than 2000 lines of codes..
So we are not proud of that project, but it was great experience!
